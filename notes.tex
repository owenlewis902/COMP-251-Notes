\section{Overview of Graph Theory}
\subsection{Definitions}
A graph $G = (V, E)$ is a set $V$ of vertices (a.k.a. nodes) and a set $E$ of edges (denoting vertex pairs). We set $n = |V|$, and $m = |E|$. A graph is said to be \ti{undirected} when for any edge $(u, v) \in E$ there exists an edge $(v, u) \in E$ for some nodes $u$, and $v$. A graph is said to be $\ti{directed}$ if it is not undirected. In other words, the edge set of a directed graph consists of ordered pairs where the edge set of an undirected graph consists of unordered pairs.\\\\
A \ti{walk} is a set of vertices $\{v_0, v_1, \dots, v_{\ell}\}$ such that $(v_i, v_{i+1}) \in E$, $\forall\ 0 \leq i \leq \ell$. 
A walk where $v_0 = v_{\ell}$ is said to be a \ti{circuit} or a \ti{closed walk}.
A circuit where every edge in the graph is used exactly once is known as an \ti{Eulerian circuit}. 
A \ti{cycle} is a walk $\{v_0, v_1, \dots, v_{\ell}\}$ such that every vertex is distinct except $v_0 = v_{\ell}$.
A cycle where every vertex of the graph is used exactly once is known as a \ti{Hamiltonian cycle}.
A walk where every vertex is distinct is said to be a \ti{path}.\\\\
A graph is said to be \ti{connected} if for each $u, v \in V$ there exists a walk from $u$ to $v$.
A graph is said to be \ti{disconnected} id it is not connected.
Each connected subgraph of a graph is called a \ti{component}. A connected graph therefore has exactly one component.\\\\
A connected component with no cycles is called a \ti{tree}. A graph whose components are all trees is said to be a \ti{forrest}. A tree is said to be \ti{spanning} if it contains every vertex in the graph. A vertex in a tree with at most one neighbour is called a \ti{leaf}.\\\\
A \ti{matching} is a set of vertex-disjoint edges i.e. each edge is incident to at most one other edge in a matching. A matching is said to be \ti{perfect} if every vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the matching.\\\\
A \ti{clique} is a set of pairwise adjacent vertices. In \ti{independent set} (a.k.a. a \ti{stable set}) is set of pairwise non-adjacent vertices.\\\\
A \ti{bipartite graph} is a graph such that the vertex set $V$ can be partitioned as $V = X \cup Y$ where each edge has one node in $X$ and the other node in $Y$. Note that $X$ and $Y$ are necessarily independent sets.
\subsection{Some Theorems for Undirected Graphs}
\thm (Handshaking Lemma) Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph, let $\Ga(v) := \{u : (u, v) \in E\}$ be the set of neighbours of a node $v$, and let the \ti{degree} $\deg(v)$ of a vertex $v$ equal the cardinality of $\Ga(v)$. Then there are an even number of vertices with odd degree.\\
\proo First note that since we're double-counting the number of pairs where $(v, e)$ is an edge incident to $v$
\[2 \x |E| = \sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) \]
Since the degree of a vertex is either even or odd, we can partition $V$ into a set of odd-degree vertices $\mathcal{O}$, and a set of even-degree vertices $\mathcal{E}$. This gives us
\[\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = \sum_{v \in \mathcal{O}} \deg(v) + \sum_{v \in \mathcal{E}} \deg(v)\]
which implies
\[\sum_{v \in \mathcal{O}} \deg(v) = 2\x |E| - \sum_{v \in \mathcal{E}} \deg(v)\]
since both the $2\x |E|$ term is even (obvious) and the $\displaystyle \sum_{v \in \mathcal{E}} \deg(v)$ term is even (sum of even numbers) then the $\displaystyle \sum_{v \in \mathcal{O}} \deg(v)$ term must also be even.
\qed\\\\
\thm (Euler's Theorem) If $G$ is an undirected graph then $G$ contains an Eulerian circuit if and only if every vertex has even degree.\\
\proo Easy proof by induction\\\\
\lem A tree $T$ with $n \geq 2$ vertices has at least one leaf vertex.\\
\proo Trees are connected so there exists no vertices with degree 0 when $n \geq 2$. Suppose each vertex has degree of at least 2. Then consider the longest path $P \subseteq T$, $P = \{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_{\ell-1}, v_{\ell}\}$. Since $\deg(v_{\ell}) \geq 2$, $\exists$ a neighbour (of $v_{\ell}$) $x \in P$ with $x \neq v_{\ell-1}$. If $x = v_{\ell + 1}$ then $P$ is not the longest path, a contradiction. Therefore, for $P$ to be the longest path, $x$ must be somewhere else in $P$, but this creates a cycle, another contradiction. Thus there must exist at least one node $v$ such that $0\ \lt\ \deg(v)\ \lt\ 2$ -- a leaf.
\qed\\\\
\thm A tree with $n$ vertices has exactly $n-1$ edges.\\
\proo Simple proof by induction.\\
\ti{Base case:} A tree with one vertex trivially has 0 edges.\\
\ti{Induction Hypothesis:} Assume any tree with $n-1$ vertices has $n-2$ edges.\\
\ti{Inductive Step:} Take a tree with $n \geq 2$ vertices. By the previous lemma this tree contains a leaf vertex $v$. This implies that $T\setminus\{v\}$ is a tree with $n-1$ vertices and by the induction hypothesis $T \setminus \{v\}$ is a tree with $n-2$ edges, which imples that $T$ is a tree with $n-1$ edges.
\qed\\\\
\thm (Hall's Theorem) Let $G = (X \cup Y, E)$ with $|X| = |Y|$ be a bipartite graph. $G$ contains a perfect matching if and only if $\forall\ B \subseteq X$, $|\Ga(B)| \geq |B|$ (Hall's condition).\\
\proo Firstly, the ($\imply$) direction is fairly obvious. If $B \subseteq X$ with $\Ga(B)\ \lt\ |B|$ then the graph can't have a perfect matching. The ($\Leftarrow$) direction is a bit trickier. Suppose Hall's condition is satisfied. Then, take the maximum cardinality matching $M$ is the graph. If $M$ is perfect then we are done. Otherwise there must exist an unmached vertex $b_0$.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Since Hall's condition holds, we have $|\Ga(\{b_0\})| \geq |\{b_{0}\}| = 1$ so $b_0$ must have at least one neighbour $s_0$.
	\item Suppose $s_0$ is matched in $M$ to $b_1$.
	\item Since Hall's condition holds, we have $|\Ga(\{b_0, b_1\})| \geq |\{b_{0}, b_1\}| = 2$ so $\{b_0, b_1\}$ must have at least one neighbour $s_1 \neq s_0$.
	\item Suppose $s_1$ is matched in $M$ to $b_2$.
	\item Since Hall's condition holds, we have $|\Ga(\{b_0, b_1, b_2\})| \geq |\{b_{0}, b_1, b_2\}| = 3$ so $\{b_0, b_1, b_2\}$ must have at least one neighbour $s_2 \notin \{s_0, s_1\}$.
	\item \dots
\end{itemize}
we repeat this argument as long as we can. Since the graph contains a finite number of vertices this process must terminate, but it can only terminate when we reach an unmatched node $s_k$. Using the edges we've formed in $M$ we can create a path $P$ from $b_0$ to $s_k$ that alternates between using non-matching edges and using matching edges. Swapping the matching edges with the non-matching edges gives us one more matching edge (as we have an odd number of edges.) This is still a valid matching as the internal nodes of $P$ are still incident to exactly one matching edge. Also, the end nodes, $b_0$ and $s_k$ were previously unmatched but are now incident to exactly one edge in the new matching. Thus $M$ isn't the maximum capacity matching -- a contradiction.
\qed
\subsection{``````Data Structures'''''' for Representing Graphs}
\subsubsection{Adjacency Matrices}
For a graph, an \ti{adjacency matrix} $M$ is a matrix suxh that
\begin{enumerate}
	\item There is a row for each vertex
	\item There is a column for each vertex
	\item The $ij-th$ entry is defined as $M_{ij} = 
\begin{cases}
1, (i, j) \in E\\
0, (i, j) \notin E
\end{cases}$
\end{enumerate}
Note that in an undirected graph the matric is symmetric around the diagonal because $(i, j) \sim (j, i)$. Of course this is not necessarily true of directed graphs.
\subsubsection{Adjacency Lists}
An \ti{adjacency list} of an undirected graph is such that for each vertex $v$ of $V$ we store a list of its neighbours. For a directed graph we have two lists: one in which we store the in-neighbours of $v$ and one in which we store the out-neighbours of $v$.
\subsubsection{Adjacency Matrices vs. Adjacency Lists}
The main difference between the two is the amount of storage required to implement them.
\begin{itemize}
	\item An adjacency matrix requires we store $\Theta(n^2)$ numbers
	\item An adjacency list requires we store $\Theta(m)$ numbers
\end{itemize}
In any graph $m = O(n^2)$. This means that for a sparse graph adjacency lists are highly favourable in terms of space complexity.\\\\
Verifying whether an edge exists, however, is much faster in an adjacency matrix -- when using the array representation of a matrix it takes $O(1)$ time, where verifying the existance of an edge takes $O(\log n)$ time for an ordered adjacency list (using binary search), and $O(n)$ time if the adjacency list is not ordered (using sequential search).
